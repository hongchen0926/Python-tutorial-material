# Python-tutorial-material
This repository includes questions and answer sheets that I created for students when I was leading the recitation sessions on Pyhton at Stony Brook University in Summer 2018 and Fall 2018. Some of the practice questions are modified from the teaching materials used for LIN 120 Langauge and Technology https://github.com/CompLab-StonyBrook/lin120_public
